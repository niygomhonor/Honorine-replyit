<br><strong>Playing positions</strong><br/>

<br>Handball positions consist of a goalkeeper, two fullbacks, two wingers, a circle runner and a center.<br/>
Here's the lowdown on these handball playing positions

There are 14 players in each team in handball, with seven on the pitch at any one time.

<br><li><strong>Goalkeeper</strong> — the player who defends the goal with just about every part of the body! <br/>
The goalkeeper is the only player who can touch the ball with their feet.</li>

<br><li><strong>Centre</strong> — a creative handball player who directs play in both defense and attack. <br/>
Also known as the ‘playmaker’ and sets up the tactics and the players in shooting positions.</li>

<br> <li><strong>Left and right backs</strong> — usually the largest players on the handball team. When defending, <br/>
they try to block shots,and in attack they are the long-range handball shooters.</li>

<br><li><strong>Circle runner</strong> — the creative force in attack and disruption to opponents when defending. <br/>
The circle runner is quick and gets in among opposing defenders to either create openings for teammates or 
<br>to get into a good scoring position themselves.<br/></li>

<li><strong>Left and right wingers</strong> — the fast players who patrol the sides of the court. They counter 
<br>opposing wingers and in attack look to create openings for others, or shoot from the more difficult angles.<br/></li>

     <h1>Warming up</h1>
     <p> <br>Warming up is a very important part of the training, which often is forgotten.<br/>

It is common the see player's rush into the court, when their training starts and starts shooting at the goal in full force usually jump shoots. <br>Unfortunately it is also common to see the result -  strained shoulder- and leg muscles and then the training is over for their part.<br/>

The goalkeeper's life is not much easier and must - with cold hands and muscles - bound around and try to be an able goalkeeper.

<br>The warming up has the following purposes:<br/>
1. to increase the capacity
<br>2. to prevent injuries<br/>
3. to make the player mental ready for the coming  activity (training/match)

<br>By warming up the body's temperature increases which again starts the body's chemical processes that again increase the body's capacity.<br>

As a main principle the warming up must be arranged in such a way that: 
<br>- it is exiting and motivating<br/>
- it is similar to the handball game
<br>- all groups of muscles are accounted for<br/>
- it takes into consideration that the body is not warmed up yet (not too much strain) 
<br>- it contains an increasing intensity in the exercises<br/>
- the warming up becomes a natural part of a training- and match situation

<strong><br>Warming up the player (and goalkeeper)<br/></strong>
<br>Warming up does not have to be boring. Various small ball games can be used which at the same time related to the game.<br/> <br>The important thing is, that all muscles are used before fast and powerful exercises are used.<br/>

<strong><br>Warming up the goalkeeper<br/></strong>
<br>Start up with loose balls directly at the goalkeeper, in order that the hands are warmed up and gets used to the blow from the ball.<br/> Then start with high balls in the sides of the goal, but still loose balls. Then low balls in order that the goalkeeper can use her legs. 
<br>Then the goalkeeper will be ready and the players can now start shooting with force.<br/>

Below some examples to be used in warming up. Many of them can include a ball, which can be dribbled and passed to each other during the exercises.
